* Kafka
** Concepts
   - Topic -- a specific queue that you write to or read from
   - Consumer group -- reads from a topic. Basically a logical consumer of a queue. Can have many per topic, duh. Each CG tracks its offset for each partition in a topic.
   - Partitions -- a topic is split into some number of these. Sets an upper bound on read parallelism for CGs for a topic.
   - Broker -- a node in the Kafka cluster. They use Zookeeper to determine who's in charge of each topic / partition. Consumers and producers read / write to a broker.
