* Feature Representation

** TF-IDF
   - 
** Word2Vec
** One-hot: make your categorical data usable by continuous functions like logistic regression
** Bucketing: the reverse of one-hot, sorta -- take continuous features and make them discrete
** Word counts -- like one-hot but with a little more information
** n-grams
** Polynomial expansion -- the synthetic features trick from linear regression
** PCA (low priority)
