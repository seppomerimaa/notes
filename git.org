* Git

git add -u --> stages modified or removed files
git add . --> stage new or modified files

git checkout -t -b new-branch-name origin/develop
git push -u origin new-branch-name

Creating a new repo:
- gotta do it through the website
- then locally,
	- git init
	- git remote add origin hhtps://...
	- git push origin master
	- also maybe git branch -u origin/master master
	
	
Removing a branch (after a PR)
local:
git branch -D branch-to-delete

remote:
git push origin --delete branch-to-delete

git fetch release
	this'll pull the latest from the marin org
	
	
Just watch this:

git stash
git stash list
git stash pop
	does what you would think
git stash apply
	like pop, but doesn't remove from stash list
git stash -k -u
	-k stashes just unstaged stuff
	-u also stashes untracked
	
	
git add .
git commit --amend


Prune all local branches that have been merged into your current branch (do this from develop):
git branch --merged | xargs git branch -d

Prune branches not on remote (looks like this means ones not set up to track remote -- ones that are tracking remote but where remote has been deleted seem like they're not getting pruned)
git remote prune origin

Prune remote branches that have already been merged (scarytown~)
git branch -r --merged | grep origin | grep -v develop | cut -d"/" -f 2 | xargs git push origin --delete
